This repository contains some begginer level python projects. These were my classroom projects and assignments. It also contains my two major projects. The details are below:


A). A basic Banking Management system Using Python


This system allows users to create accounts, define Account Class, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, list all account holders, display & modify account details and close accounts.


B). A data Processing Model (With ".csv" file)


This model prepares a dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, splitting the dataset into training and test sets, and scaling the features using standardization. It imports the data from a CSV file, performs preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, splits the dataset into training and test sets, and scales the features to prepare them for model training.
