This repository contains some begginer level python projects. These were my classroom projects and assignments. It also contains my two major projects. The details are below:


A). A basic Banking Management system Using Python


This system allows users to create accounts, define Account Class, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, list all account holders, display & modify account details and close accounts.


B). A data Processing Model (With "Data.csv" file). A brief overview of what each section of the code does is given below:


1. Importing the necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
2. Importing the Dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and separating the independent variables (features) X and the dependent variable (target) y.
3. Taking Care of Missing Data using the SimpleImputer class from scikit-learn by replacing missing values with the mean of the respective columns.
4. Encoding Categorical Data using one-hot encoding for the independent variables (X) and label encoding for the dependent variable (y).
5. Splitting the Dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
6. Feature Scaling to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process.
