This repository contains some begginer level python projects. These were my classroom projects and assignments. 


It also contain an data processing model with the "data.csv" file. The details are below:

Here's a brief overview of what each section of the code does:

1. Importing the Libraries: You imported necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
2. Importing the Dataset: You loaded your dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and separated the independent variables (features) X and the dependent variable (target) y.
3. Taking Care of Missing Data: You handled missing data using the SimpleImputer class from scikit-learn by replacing missing values with the mean of the respective columns.
4. Encoding Categorical Data: You encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding for the independent variables (X) and label encoding for the dependent variable (y).
5. Splitting the Dataset: You split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
6. Feature Scaling: You scaled the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process.
